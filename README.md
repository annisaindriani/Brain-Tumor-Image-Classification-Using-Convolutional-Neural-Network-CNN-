# Brain Tumor Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
## Description
This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for the classification of brain tumor images in the healthcare sector. The dataset was processed through data augmentation and resizing images to a resolution of 64 x 64 pixels. The initial CNN architecture featured ReLU activation functions for hidden layers and a softmax activation function for the output layer, with training and validation loss graphs generated to assess model performance.

To enhance the model's robustness, modifications were made by incorporating dropout and batch normalization techniques. The refined architecture was evaluated using a testing set, allowing for a comprehensive comparison of predicted outcomes against actual labels. This evaluation provided insights into the effectiveness of the model in accurately classifying brain tumor images.
